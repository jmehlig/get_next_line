# get_next_line

Simple project for the better understanding of pointers and static variables.
The get_next_line function reads one line at a time from a given file, using the read() function.

The function uses a variable for BUFFER_SIZE, which should be included into the compilation.
Repeated calls of the function are able to read a complete file.
